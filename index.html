                <h1 id="second-section-title">What is the coronavirus?</h1>
                <p id="second-section-text">The coronavirus (COVID-19) is a common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viral disease</a> that has been classified
                as a world pandemic virus since February 2020 by the <a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Health Organisation</a>. The name coronavirus is derived from the fact that the 
                structure of the virus is like a crown, as you can see on the <a href="information.html">info</a> page. Observing the inner 
                structure, we can see that it is made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RNA</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">N protein</a>
                </a> and the outside is protected by <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P59594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spike glycoprotein (S)</a>. This pandemic has caused the world economy to crash,
                and the world population to be put in a strict lockdown. This emphasises its severity, and lethality. Older people are at a higher risk than younger people, due to the fact that the 
                virus attacks the respiratory system. Some countries are significantly affected by the virus and will continue to be affected, such as the United Kingdom, the United 
                States of America, Brazil or Russia, and some countries are not affected by the virus in such a significant extent, such as Vietman, Syria and Taiwan. The country with the
                lowest coronavirus cases is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Pierre_and_Miquelon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saint Pierre and Miquelon</a> with 2 cases, 0 deaths and 2 people recovered.</p>

                <h1 id="third-section-title">How is it spread?</h1>
                <p id="third-section-text">The coronavirus is spread mainly through these 3 methods:</p>
                <ul id="third-section-list">
                    <li><b>Droplets:</b> When an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes, they transmit tiny particles in the form of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/droplet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                    droplets</a>. These droplets can be inhaled by another person if they are standing close enough (2 metres).</li>
                    <li><b>Airborne:</b> The droplets can live in the air for up to 3 hours. This means that if you breathe that air, you can get infected.</li>
                    <li><b>Surface:</b> If you touch a surface that has been infected with the coronavirus, then you are likely to catch it. This is because the virus can live on surfaces for 2 to 3 
                    days, emphasising the importance of wearing gloves.</li>
